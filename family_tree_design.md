- **Link Design**:
  - Horizontal links showing parent-child relationships
  - Link distance optimized for readability

### 1.2 Timeline
- Position: Bottom of the view
- Design:
  - Horizontal slider
  - Current year display
  - Interactive year selection
- Functionality:
  - Dynamic update of node status (living/deceased/unborn)
  - Temporal filtering of family members

### 1.3 Location Filter
- Position: Top of the view
- Design:
  - Multi-select dropdown menu
  - "All locations" option available
- Functionality:

  - Opacity-based filtering

## 2. Interaction Design

### 2.1 Node Interaction
- Hover: Display detailed tooltip with:
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Birth year
  - Death year (if applicable)
  - Location
  - Current status
- Click:
  - Highlight relatives
  - Show direct relationships
  - Identify cousins

### 2.2 Search and Filter Features
- Name search:
  - Real-time filtering
  - Case-insensitive matching

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Member Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "name": "Full Name",
  "gender": "male/female",
  "birthYear": "birth_year",
  "deathYear": "death_year",
  "location": "place_name",
  "children": ["child_id1", "child_id2"]
}
```

### 3.2 Relationship Types
- Direct relationships:
  - Parent-child connections
  - Sibling relationships
- Extended relationships:
  - Cousin identification
  - Ancestor-descendant paths
